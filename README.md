<p>Added minimax algorithm to the game.Making it much difficult for the users to win game against the computer.</p>
<p>A Minimax algorithm can be best defined as a recursive function that does the following things:
<ul type="circle">
  <li>return a value if a terminal state is found (+10, 0, -10)</li>
  <li>go through available spots on the board</li>
  <li>call the minimax function on each available spot (recursion)</li>
  <li>evaluate returning values from function calls</li>
  <li>and return the best value</li></p>
